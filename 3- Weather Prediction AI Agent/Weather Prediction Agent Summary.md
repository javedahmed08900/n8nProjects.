# **Weather Prediction  AI Agent (n8n Workflow)**

# **Overview**

The Weather Prediction Agent is an AI-powered automation workflow developed in n8n that delivers real-time weather updates, short-term forecasts, and safety alerts through an interactive chat interface. It integrates OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini, SerpAPI, and Wikipedia tools to ensure precise, context-aware, and location-specific weather reports. The assistant intelligently interprets user queries and responds in a structured, professional, and concise manner.

# **Core Components**

-  Platform: n8n (No-Code Automation Tool)   
-  OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini Model for natural language understanding and text generation.   
-  SerpAPI & Wikipedia Integrations for live weather data and factual enhancement. 
-  Used Simple Memory, It can be customized.

# **Objective**

The main objective of the Weather Prediction Agent project is to develop an intelligent, AI-based system that simplifies access to accurate and timely weather information. The assistant aims to enhance user experience by delivering location-specific forecasts, actionable safety advice, and reliable meteorological insights. By combining AI reasoning with real-time data retrieval, the project demonstrates how automation can make complex information easily understandable and accessible through natural conversation.

# **Key Features**

-  **Real-Time Weather Data:** Retrieves live weather information from SerpAPI for any global location.   
-  **Conversational AI Interface:** Interprets user messages naturally and provides structured weather reports.   
-  **Contextual Memory:** Stores recent chat data for smooth, multi-turn conversations.   
-  **Knowledge Enhancement:** Uses Wikipedia for contextual meteorological explanations.   
-  **Smart Localization:** Automatically displays temperature in Celsius and wind speed in mph, depending on the users region.   


# **Workflow Process**

1. **Chat Trigger Activation:** The workflow begins when a user sends a message (e.g.,  What s the weather in Dubai? ).
2. **AI Agent Initialization:** The AI Agent interprets the query, identifies missing details such as location, and prepares a structured     response plan.
3. **Data Retrieval via Tools:** SerpAPI Node fetches live weather data and Wikipedia Node provides supporting background information or explanations.
4. **Response Generation:** The OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini model processes all retrieved information and generates a concise, professional weather  report.
5. **Memory Handling:** Used Simple memory but it may be customized.
6. **Final Output:** The assistant delivers the final message containing current weather, short-term forecast, and any alerts or advice.

# **Technical Nodes Used in Workflow**

-  **When Chat Message Received:** Triggers the workflow whenever a user sends a chat query.   
-  **AI Agent:** Acts as the main controller, processing user messages and managing responses.   
-  **OpenAI Chat Model:** Generates accurate and natural language responses.  
-  **Simple Memory:** Maintains short-term chat context for coherent conversation.  
-  **Wikipedia Tool:** Retrieves relevant meteorological knowledge for enhanced explanations.   
-  **SerpAPI Tool:** Collects live and accurate weather data for requested locations.

# **Use Cases & Benefits**

-  **Daily Forecasting:** Provides users with up-to-date weather information anytime.
-  **Travel Planning:** Helps travelers and outdoor enthusiasts plan based on accurate forecasts.   
-  **Emergency Awareness:** Issues timely alerts and safety guidelines during severe weather.   
-  **Business Operations:** Supports logistics, agriculture, and event management sectors that depend on weather data.  

# **Outcome**

The Weather Prediction Agent successfully showcases how AI, automation, and real-time data integration can be combined within n8n to create a fully functional, conversational weather assistant. The system delivers accurate information with human-like interaction, offering an efficient and professional user experience. This project stands as a practical example of how no-code AI workflows can power intelligent digital solutions for both personal and enterprise applications.
