nn **Project Name: Weather Prediction Agent (n8n AI Workflow)**

**Overview**

The Weather Prediction Agent is an AI-powered automation workflow developed in n8n that delivers real-time weather updates, short-term forecasts, and safety alerts through an interactive chat interface. It integrates OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini, SerpAPI, and Wikipedia tools to ensure precise, context-aware, and location-specific weather reports. The assistant intelligently interprets user queries and responds in a structured, professional, and concise manner.

**Core Components**

`  `n8n AI Workflow Builder for automation and orchestration.   LangChain Framework for managing AI reasoning, memory, and external tool integration.   OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini Model for natural language understanding and text generation.   SerpAPI & Wikipedia Integrations for live weather data and factual enhancement.   Memory Buffer System for maintaining short-term conversational context.

**Objective**

The main objective of the Weather Prediction Agent project is to develop an intelligent, AI-based system that simplifies access to accurate and timely weather information. The assistant aims to enhance user experience by delivering location-specific forecasts, actionable safety advice, and reliable meteorological insights. By combining AI reasoning with real-time data retrieval, the project demonstrates how automation can make complex information easily understandable and

accessible through natural conversation.

**Key Features**

`  `n Real-Time Weather Data: Retrieves live weather information from SerpAPI for any global location.   n Conversational AI Interface: Interprets user messages naturally and provides structured weather reports.   n Contextual Memory: Stores recent chat data for smooth, multi-turn conversations.   n Knowledge Enhancement: Uses Wikipedia for contextual meteorological explanations.   n Smart Localization: Automatically displays temperature in Celsius and wind speed in mph, depending on the user s region.   nn Weather Alerts & Safety Tips: Generates safety recommendations for extreme weather conditions.

**Workflow Process**

1\. Chat Trigger Activation: The workflow begins when a user sends a message (e.g.,  What s the weather in Dubai? ). 2. AI Agent Initialization: The AI Agent interprets the query, identifies missing details such as location, and prepares a structured response plan. 3. Data Retrieval via Tools: SerpAPI Node fetches live weather data and Wikipedia Node provides supporting background information or explanations. 4. Response Generation: The OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini model processes all retrieved information and generates a concise, professional weather report. 5. Memory Handling: The Memory Buffer Node ensures the conversation remains contextually consistent, enabling fluid interaction. 6. Final Output: The assistant delivers the final message containing current weather, short-term forecast, and any alerts or advice.

**Technical Nodes Used in Workflow**

`  `When Chat Message Received: Triggers the workflow whenever a user sends a chat query.   AI Agent: Acts as the main controller, processing user messages and managing responses.   OpenAI Chat Model (GPT-4.1-mini): Generates accurate and natural language responses.   Simple Memory: Maintains short-term chat context for coherent conversation.   Wikipedia Tool: Retrieves relevant meteorological knowledge for enhanced explanations.   SerpAPI Tool: Collects live and accurate weather data for requested locations.

**Use Cases & Benefits**

`  `nn Daily Forecasting: Provides users with up-to-date weather information anytime.   nn Travel Planning: Helps travelers and outdoor enthusiasts plan based on accurate forecasts.   n Emergency Awareness: Issues timely alerts and safety guidelines during severe weather.   n Business Operations: Supports logistics, agriculture, and event management sectors that depend on weather data.   n AI & Automation Showcase: Demonstrates how AI-driven automation can replace complex coding with smart, no-code solutions.

**Outcome**

The Weather Prediction Agent successfully showcases how AI, automation, and real-time data integration can be combined within n8n to create a fully functional, conversational weather assistant. The system delivers accurate information with human-like interaction, offering an efficient and professional user experience. This project stands as a practical example of how no-code AI workflows can power intelligent digital solutions for both personal and enterprise applications.
