# **PROJECT NO. 01**
# **WhatsApp RAG AI Agent**

I built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI assistant that answers questions about Microsoft's 2024 Annual Report directly through WhatsApp.

# **What This Project Does**

- **RAG System:** Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide accurate answers from the Microsoft 2024 Annual Report.

- **Used the Microsoft 2024 Annual Report (PDF)** as the primary data source for retrieval and context generation.

- **Chat with Document:** Ask questions on WhatsApp, and the AI finds specific answers from the report.

- **Built with n8n:** Created the entire RAG agent visually using n8n work flow tool.

- **WhatsApp Integration:** Used WhatsApp as the trigger for conversations.

- **Pinecone Vector DB**: Stored and searched document embedding in Pinecone.

- **Google Gemini:** Used Gemini model for embedding and generating responses.

# **How It Works**

 - You send a question on WhatsApp (trigger).

- My n8n RAG workflow searches Pinecone for relevant information from the Microsoft report.

- Google Gemini processes the context and sends accurate answers back to WhatsApp.

- This RAG project helped me learn how to build AI agents that can chat with documents and provide reliable information.
